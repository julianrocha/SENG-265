# Test files SENG 265 Spring 2018

The files in this directory consist of pairs. For example:
* in01.txt and out01.txt are a pair
* in02.txt and out02.txt are a pair
* etc.

The idea is that the content of the file-pair's input file should, when
redirected into ./kwic1, result in the same content as can be found in the
output file.
